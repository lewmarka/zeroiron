OUTSTANDING LIST OF ISSUES:

-Deleting Courses: must check for single quotes in string name.
-Validate strings/data entered for data entry (non-null, etc...)
-refactor ZeroIronCourseEdit like ZeroIronGameEdit (onClickListeners and stuff)
-refactor dbAdapter as singleton
-change KEY_ROWID with proper ids from the defined constants...
-cleanup constants for db tables access - should all reside in DbAdapter, not in activities classes.
	-move COURSE_STRUCTURE into Db object.
-Fix time AM/PM display bug when:
	-creating a new game record
	-loading an existing game record
